        <li>
           <strong>Genesis:</strong>  After First World war, the Industrialization were on rise and the engineering activity took a positive shape in India. As a consequence, need was felt to uphold the quality in products and operations of the Engineering domain.  Accordingly Government of India formed an Indian Industrial Commission under the Chairmanship Sir Thomas Holland, the then Commerce member of the then Govt. of India. The commission recommended the establishment of an Institution as a professional body of engineers to ensure advancement of technology and uphold the quality of products in various stages of production.
        </li>
        <li>         
            <strong>On</strong> the basis of the recommendation several meetings of the leading engineers were held in various parts of country and “Indian Society of Engineers” was formed in 03 Jan 1919 at Calcutta. Subsequently, rules and constitution were drafted and circulated nationwide for the all interested people. Finally, with gained momentum of the efforts undertaken, a meeting was held in 16 Jul 1919 at Shimla to consider all modification and additions and the name of the Society was changed to The Institution of Engineers (India).
